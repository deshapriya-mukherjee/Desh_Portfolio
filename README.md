# [Project 2: Customer Churn Project with Logistic Regression Machine Learning Model: Project Overview](https://github.com/deshapriya-mukherjee/Customer-Churn-Project.git)

# Built the model using Logistic Regression from Scikit-learn package. This function implements logistic regression and can use different numerical optimizers to find parameters.

2. Data Exploration and Visualization.
3. Data Cleaning, Outlier Detection, Skewness Checking,Correlated independent variables ommiting, Dealing with Contineous and Categorical Independent Variables, Proper Scaling, Making Logistic Regression Model and Finally Checking accuracy of classifier is to look at confusion matrix.
4. The classifier correctly predicted 24 of them as 0, and one of them wrongly as 1. So, it has done a good job in predicting the customers with churn value 0. A good thing about confusion matrix is that shows the model’s ability to correctly predict or separate the classes.  In specific case of binary classifier, such as this example,  we can interpret these numbers as the count of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
5. The F1score is the harmonic average of the precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0. It is a good way to show that a classifer has a good value for both recall and precision.
6. And finally, we can tell the average accuracy for this classifier is the average of the f1-score for both labels, which is 0.76 in our case.
